\section{LICM: Loop Invariant Code Motion}

\begin{itemize}

\item{
    \textbf{Loop-invariant instructions}\\

    These are the loop-invariant instructions : $\{ S_{2}, S_{3}, S_{5}, S_{6}, S_{8}, S_{9}, S_{11}, S_{12} \}$.
    This is because the values of these computations  don't change as long as the control stays within
    the  loop.

    These instructions are not loop-invariant : $\{ S_{1}, S_{4}, S_{7}, S_{10} \}$. They have multiple
    reaching definitions.
  }

  \item{
    \textbf{Loop-invariant instructions that can be moved to the pre-header}\\

    These instructions can be moved to the pre-header : $\{ S_{3}, S_{12} \}$.

    The other instructions don't satisfy atleast one of these rules. Either they don't have only one definition in
    the loop. Or, the block in which they are present does not dominate all the loop exits in which the LHS
    of the instruction is live.
    Or, they are live out of the pre-header.
    
  }
