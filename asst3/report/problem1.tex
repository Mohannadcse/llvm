\section{Register Allocation}

The annotated CFG and the associated interference graph are shown below. 

We first identify the live ranges of all the variables and construct the
interference graph. We then provide a 4-coloring of this graph.
Thus, it is possible to allocate the variables in this procedure to 4
physical registers.
