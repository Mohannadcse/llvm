+ Source code is available in the "ClassicalDataFlow" folder. After running "make", 
the passes can be applied on any test input.

+ The test files are in "tests" sub-directories within "ClassicalDataFlow" directory.

+ Sample usage of passes :

As "-licm" collides with existing LLVM pass, we instead use "-loop-invariant-code-motion"
As "-dce" collides with existing LLVM pass, we instead use "-dead-code-elimination"

opt -load ./LoopInvariantCodeMotion.so -loop-invariant-code-motion -loop-simplify -licm tests/licm_test_3.bc -o out
opt -load ./DeadCodeElimination.so -dead-code-elimination  tests/dce_test_2.bc -o out; llvm-dis out; vi out.ll

+ A copy of the report is present in this directory.
